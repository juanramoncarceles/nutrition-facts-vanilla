Features:
  ☐ Make that clicking on the food title also opens the food list.
  ☐ Close the list with ESC key.
  ☐ Make SVG UI responsive, so for example if the smatphone is landscape it has the circe in the middle and two columns on each side or the circle in one side and the columns on the other.
  ☐ After searching, if a food item doesn't exist set a sentence or image saying that this item is not available.
  ☐ Add clear input button, like a small cross on the right side.

Changes:
  ☐ Make food list equivalent to the active or disabled style so only one class is needed.
