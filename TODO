☐ Make responsive for small screens like phones. Is to high so it should adapt to window height. (Take into account when orientation is landscape on a phone).
  ▫ On the new structure:
    - The food title and the main svg should be inside a container and it centered vertically.
    - The problem is that the choosed item wouldnt match vertically, so it would be better to think of another option (svg symbols? img scr with the same?, move the element?)
    - The footer without the added margin top, because it would be pushed to the bottom as the last flex item of the column.

☐ Make that clicking on the food title also opens the food list.

☐ Make the magnifying glass morph to cross.

☐ Github icon on the lower corner.

☐ Close the list with ESC key.

☐ Make food list equivalent to the active or disabled style so only one class is needed.

☐ Make SVG UI responsive, so for example if the smatphone is landscape it has the circe in the middle and two columns on each side or the circle in one side and the columns on the other.
