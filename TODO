☐ Make responsive for small screens like phones. Is to high so it should adapt to window height. (Take into account when orientation is landscape on a phone).
  ▫ On the new structure:
    - The food title and the main svg should be inside a container and it centered vertically.
    - The problem is that the choosed item wouldnt match vertically, so it would be better to think of another option (svg symbols? img scr with the same?, move the element?)
    - The footer without the added margin top, because it would be pushed to the bottom as the last flex item of the column.

☐ Make that clicking on the food title also opens the food list.

☐ Rename the #valoresNutricionales id

☐ Make the magnifying glass morph to cross.

☐ Github icon on the lower corner.

☐ Set vertical mediaquery also for the root font-size.
